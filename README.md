# Hangman Game

A classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. Guess the word one letter at a time before the hangman is fully drawn!

## 🎮 Features

- Single-player word guessing
- Random word selection from a list
- ASCII art hangman visuals
- Tracks correct and incorrect guesses
- Win/Lose end messages

## 📚 How to Play

1. A random word is selected (hidden from the player).
2. You guess one letter at a time.
3. Correct guesses reveal the letter's position(s) in the word.
4. Incorrect guesses draw one part of the hangman.
5. The game ends when:
   - You guess the word correctly 🎉
   - OR the hangman is fully drawn 💀

## 🧠 Rules

- Only one letter can be guessed at a time.
- You can’t guess the same incorrect letter twice.
- The number of incorrect guesses allowed is limited (usually 6 or 7).
- The game is case-insensitive.
